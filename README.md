## Installation
This file will only work in Sketch. 
* Open sketch preferences and click on "Libraries"
<img src="./Assets/libraries_screen.png">
<br />
* Navigate to wheever you've stored this library file
* Import it into your libraries
* Access the MASTER cell using the Insert > Symbol, or, if you're like me, use Sketch Runner to add an instance of the s ymbol.. 

## Features
* Contains a Symbol that allows a user to create an infinitely scalable square cell with over-rideable borders.
* Provides three border weights and several border colors to start with.


## Usage
1. You can use this symbol library to create anything you want. While this file focuses on tables, the library is also really great for building out all kinds of stuff. 
2. Adding new colors and border weights is easy. Just add another width to the symbol set and update the master border controls to reflect the new widths.

## Coming soon
I'm working on another version of this format that uses excluslively shadow controls. We'll see if the performance of this is a bit faster.
